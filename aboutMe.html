										As an athlete, I’ve always had to push myself out of my comfort zone. This has taught me persistence and made me able to thrive under pressure. It has also made me want to pursue a career at a top firm that offers support, challenges, and opportunities. I’m social and positive, and communicating with others is one of my greatest strengths. My expertise and enthusiasm focus mostly on Technology, and Business and understanding how to combine these and I truly believe that my skill set combined with my ability to work with others will be an asset in the workforce.

								<h3>It all started with skiing</h3>
									<p>Since a kid, I've been skiing and loving it. At the age of 15, I wanted to pursue my athletic dream and moved away from home. While completing my high school diploma I was racing around Europe. Eventually, all this led to me getting an offer to compete in NCAA Division I skiing in Utah at Westminster College. I said yes to this new adventure which has so far been the best decision in my life. After starting my bachelor's degree in Business, I quickly realized my interest in Computer Science and switched it to my major. Since then, I've been eager to learn more about Business and Technology and how I could combine these two new passions of mine.

								<h3>Where am I now</h3>
								<p>Last summer I got an opportunity to be part of a software development company in Helsinki, Finland. During my internship, I was building the frontend side of websites with a help of professionals by using the Vue framework. I was lucky enough to receive feedback on code optimization and general learning process from the firm senior engineer. Being an intern taught me how to overcome real-life challenges and it improved my analytical focus. </p>
