									<p>
										As an athlete, I’ve always had to push myself out of my comfort zone. 
										This has taught me persistence and made me able to thrive under pressure. 
										It has also made me want to pursue a career at a top firm that offers support, challenges, and opportunities. 
										I’m social and positive, and communicating with others is one of my greatest strengths. 
										My expertise and enthusiasm focus mostly on Technology, and Business and understanding how to combine these and 
										I truly believe that my skill set combined with my ability to work with others will be an asset in the workforce.

								<h3>It all started with skiing</h3>
									<p>Ever since I was a child, skiing has been a passion of mine. At 15, I decided to pursue my athletic dreams and moved away from home to race around Europe while also completing my high school diploma. 
										Through my dedication and hard work, I received an offer to compete in NCAA Division I skiing at Westminster College in Utah, which I accepted without hesitation. 
										This decision has proven to be the best one of my life so far. While pursuing my bachelor's degree in Business, I realized my growing interest in Computer Science, and I switched my major accordingly. 
										Since then, I've been eager to explore the intersection of Business and Technology, and how I can combine these two passions.
									</p>
								<hr />
								<h3>Where am I now</h3>
								<p>
									I am currently in the final stages of completing my Bachelor's degree in Science, and I am set to graduate this summer. 
									Alongside this, I am thrilled to have secured a Global Technology Internship at Schroders for the same period. 
									I am eager to gain new knowledge and experience through this opportunity, and I am confident that my past experiences and the skills I have acquired in school will prove valuable, 
									enabling me to further enhance my abilities and learn more during my internship.
