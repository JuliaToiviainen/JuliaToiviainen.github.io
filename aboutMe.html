										As an athlete, I’ve always had to push myself out of my comfort zone. 
										This has taught me persistence and made me able to thrive under pressure. 
										It has also made me want to pursue a career at a top firm that offers support, challenges, and opportunities. 
										I’m social and positive, and communicating with others is one of my greatest strengths. 
										My expertise and enthusiasm focus mostly on Technology, and Business and understanding how to combine these and 
										I truly believe that my skill set combined with my ability to work with others will be an asset in the workforce.

								<h3>It all started from skiing</h3>
								<p>Since a kid I've been skiing and loving it. At the age of 15, I wanted to pursue my athletic dream and moved away from home. While completing my high school diploma I was racing around Europe. Eventually, all this led to me getting an offer to compete at NCAA division I skiing in Utah at Westminster University and then to University of Colorado Boulder. 
									During my bachelor's degree I quickly realized my interest towards Computer Science and Finance. Since then I've been eager to learn more and I noticed that combining finance and technoology to be my new passion.</p>
								<hr />
								<h3>Where am I now</h3>
								<p>This summer I got and opportunity to be a Global Technology intern at Schroders, where I got exposure to multiple financial and technolocial areas. 
									The experience made me realize that financial industry is something I want to work in and I'm excited to see what the future brings!</p>
